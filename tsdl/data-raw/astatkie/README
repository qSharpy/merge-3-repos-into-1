This data was compiled from published meteorological data by Tessema
 Astatkie and used for nonlinear time series modelling in his Ph.D.
 Thesis, Queens University (1994) "Modulated Threshold Time Series
 Models". (D. Watts and E.Watt faculty advisors).

The units for flow are cms (cubic meters per second).
The units for temperature are degrees Celsius
The units for precipitation are in mm.
