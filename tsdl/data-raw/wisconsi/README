Wisconsin employment time series.
  Contains time series of employment, in units of 1000 employees,
of various industries in Wisconsin. 

Miller and Wichern (1977) fit seasonal ARIMA models to these time 
series data in their book. McLeod (1993) pointed out that some
of these time series exhibit periodic correlation. The data are
listed in Miller and Wichern's book.
