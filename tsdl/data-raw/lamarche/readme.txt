used in the paper by Fritts, H.C. et al. (1971) "Multivariate techniques
for specifying tree-growth and climatic relationships and for reconstructing
anomalies in Paleoclimate. Journal of Applied Meteorology, 10, pp.845-864.
The data was produced and assembled at the Tree Ring Laboratory at the
